-- Table Schema:
-- Table: user_goals
--   user_id: INT
--   user_type: VARCHAR
--   goal_id: INT
--   goal_status: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT user_type as 'type',AVG(A) as 'completed goals per user' FROM (SELECT user_id,user_type,COUNT(goal_id) AS A FROM user_goals
WHERE goal_status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY user_id, user_type)
GROUP BY user_type
ORDER BY 'completed goals per user' DESC;
