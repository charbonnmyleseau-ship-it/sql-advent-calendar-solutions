-- Table Schema:
-- Table: daily_quiz_scores
--   subject: VARCHAR
--   quiz_date: DATE
--   score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM (SELECT 
    subject,quiz_date,
    FIRST_VALUE(score) OVER (
        PARTITION BY subject
        ORDER BY quiz_date
      ) as first_score,
    LAST_VALUE(score) OVER (
        PARTITION BY subject
        ORDER BY quiz_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) as latest_score
FROM 
    daily_quiz_scores
ORDER BY 
    subject,quiz_date);
